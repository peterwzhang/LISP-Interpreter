# Lisp Interpreter

This is a Lisp interpreter for our CS 403 class (Programming Languages). The interpreter itself is made using Python3 and is based on Kamin's Pascal implementation of Lisp. If you would like to see our work process, tests, and compilation/testing instructions please see our [project page](https://peterwzhang.github.io/LISP-Interpreter/).
